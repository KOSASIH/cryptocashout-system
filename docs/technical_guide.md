# Technical Guide: Cryptocashout ATM System

## Architecture

The Cryptocashout ATM system consists of the following components:

* ATM Hardware: A custom-built ATM machine with a touchscreen interface and cash dispensing capabilities.
* ATM Software: A Linux-based operating system with a custom-built application for managing transactions and communicating with the backend API.
* Backend API: A RESTful API built using Node.js and MongoDB for storing and retrieving transaction data.
* Fiat Exchange Rate API: A third-party API for retrieving real-time fiat exchange rates.

## Development Environment

* Operating System: Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
* Programming Languages: JavaScript, Python
* Frameworks: Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB
* Tools: Docker, Git

## Deployment

The system is deployed using Docker containers and Kubernetes for orchestration.

## API Endpoints

* `/api/transactions`: Create a new transaction
* `/api/transactions/:id`: Retrieve a transaction by ID
* `/api/rates`: Retrieve real-time fiat exchange rates

## Database Schema

* `transactions` collection:
	+ `_id`: transaction ID
	+ `amount`: transaction amount
	+ `currency`: transaction currency
	+ `status`: transaction status (pending, completed, failed)
* `users` collection:
	+ `_id`: user ID
	+ `username`: user username
	+ `password`: user password (hashed)

## Security

* All API endpoints are secured using JSON Web Tokens (JWT) and HTTPS.
* All sensitive data is encrypted using AES-256.
* Regular security audits and penetration testing are performed to ensure the system's security.
